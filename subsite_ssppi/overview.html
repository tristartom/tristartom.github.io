<h2>Introduction</h2>
<font size=+1>
<p>
Many healthcare providers, payers, and pharmaceutical compa-nies have increased their use of eHealth solutions to manage health-related 
information and to automate administrative and clinical func-tions. We are witnessing an increasing demand for the next generation health information networks, 
which hold the promise of provid-ing large-scale information sharing over distributed, access controlled content across a network of healthcare providers. A representative
example is the work currently under way to construct the Nationwide Health Information Network (NHIN) that supports information
sharing among more than 20 federal agencies, along with numerous private hospitals and doctors’ offices. A fundamental capability of
such information network is to provide efficient, privacy-preserving search over distributed, access controlled content.
<p>
More specifically, individual healthcare providers typically enforce strict regulations over the healthcare information for a number of reasons,
such as patients’ privacy requirements, conflicting economic interests, and federal administration; meanwhile, the capability of
efficiently identifying and retrieving relevant content across health-care administrative boundaries is crucial for the healthcare information network to improve care quality, emergency response, and diag-nosis accuracy. 
This poses the question of how to facilitate effective search while minimally revealing which providers possess which con-tent (i.e., content privacy).
<p>

<h2>What is SS-PPI</h2>

<p>
The first Privacy Preserving Index (PPI) was refered to as flipping PPI to
strike a balance between privacy preservation and search efficiency.
It leverages an abstraction of group-wise index, by which providers are organized into a set of
disjoint privacy groups.1 Content privacy is preserved in the sense that providers in the same group are indistinguishable. 
Query dis-semination is performed at the granularity of privacy group. Within a privacy group, a given query is forwarded either to all providers
or to none of them, depending on whether there exists (at least) one provider with matched content. Flipping PPI is known to suffer from
index construction inefficiency, due to the large number of rounds of PPI computation, and is vulnerable to colluding attacks.
<p>
We propose the concept of role-sensitive PPI and a secure protocol for fast construction of PPI based on the primitives of
secret sharing. We entitle this concrete implementation of our role-sensitive PPI as SS-PPI. Given a query in conjunction with the role
of the querier, our role-sensitive PPI returns the groups of providers that potentially hold the content that matches the search term for this
role. Both privacy preserving and search efficiency are attained on a finer-granularity level. Since our PPI abstraction is defined on finne
granularity (role sensitive), we preserve content privacy as well as access policy privacy at the same time. 
This new type of privacy protects the sensitive information in provider-defined access rules, 
such as to which role provider p has granted access. 

<h2>Index Construction Protocol</h2>

<p>
The framework of SS-PPI mainly consists of two phases, index construction and query answering. The former further processes in
three major components, group formation, group aggregation and global index construction.

<ul>
<li><b>Component 1 - Grouping</b><br>
SS-PPI organizes providers into privacy groups. In this paper, we adopt the strategy of random grouping based on universal hashing.
<p>

<li><b>Component 2 - Secure group aggregation</b> <br>
Within each privacy group, a summarization structure is built in a privacy-preserving manner that
indexes the content possession by group members. Instead of using the generic circuit computing, SS-PPI constructs this
aggregation by an extended secrete sharing scheme, which endows our solution with both scalability and attack-resilience.
<p>

<li><b>Component 3 - Privacy-aware global index construction</b> <br>
The global index is constructed efficiently by merging the set of group aggregations. 
SS-PPI adopts a distributed scheme that not only amortizes the trust on a single third party, but also supports localized, incremental index update.
</ul>
