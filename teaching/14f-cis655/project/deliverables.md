Survey option
===
<a name="survey_0">Milestone 0: Topic selection
---
The submitted document should describe the **chosen topic** and optionally a short paragraph (less than 1 page) that describes the background and justifies the chosen topic from the perspective of meeting the three criteria mentioned in the FAQ in project page [[link](http://tristartom.github.io/teaching/14f-cis655/project/termproject.html)]. If possible, be specific regarding the topic and example real computer systems to study.

<a name="survey_1">Milestone 1: Reference selection 
---
At this stage, students should fix the list of related materials. In the submitted document, it should include all the referenced materials, be it technical research paper, white paper, or technical blogs (posted by reputable companies), that the final report will be based on.

<a name="survey_2">Milestone 2: Preliminary report
---
Submit a preliminary report of at least 4 pages. Such report should include the topic introduction (e.g. domain-specific concept, background and motivation), a broad overview of existing techniques (e.g. present a classification of those techniques with an analysis of what is pros and cons), and a detailed and in-depth description of a reprensentitive technique. Optionally, you should also include a survey of open-source projects in the domain, and submit some sample program that can demonstate the proof of concept.

<a name="survey_3">Milestone 3: Final deliverable 
---
The final deliverable includes 1) a survey paper which describes the technical advances in the corresponding topic, and 2) a presentation that summaries the results of survey paper in a clear and compact manner. In particular, the survey paper should consist of more than 15 pages (excluding reference list), formatted with one-half spacing, 12 point font, one inch borders. 
You are encouraged to submit any test source code you wrote; bonus points will be given accordingly.

In principle, the survey should address the following general questions, although specific paper organization may depend on the topic of choice.

1. What drives the emergence of the new technique? Where do the needs come about? What is the benefit?
2. What are the new technical advances? Describe the technical solution with depth -- elaborate on the protocols, data formats and architectures. Compare the new technique with prior techniques years or decades ago, and describe their differences.
3. List a number of open-source systems (if any) for the new technique. Describe your experiences using them.
4. State the problems that are yet to be solved, and how research or industry can approach them. List a few research problems.

Programming option
===
<a name="program_0"> Milestone 0: Topic selection 
---
Given a group of students, only **one** student (designated as group coordinator) needs to submit the document. The document should describe the **chosen project**, group members including both **student name** and **SUID**.

<a name="program_1"> Milestone 1: Project design
---
Finish the **reading component** of your project [[link-proj1](http://tristartom.github.io/teaching/14f-cis655/project/proj-dtracing.html), [link-proj2](http://tristartom.github.io/teaching/14f-cis655/project/proj-sgxsim.html)]. Based on your reading, design the project, write a project-design report and submit it to the blackboard link. The project design should include two parts: 1) your technical review of the readings, 2) a preliminary plan to achieve the first project goal (i.e. for the trace project, it is related to ``HBase`` deployment, trace collection and analysis; for SGX project, it is to design the implementation of simulator).

<a name="program_2"> Milestone 2: Implementation and deployment
---
Follow the project plan to set up and deploy the original system. To demonstrate the working of the system, students should submit a series of screen-shots of **the functioning system**.

Implement the proposed design, test it and deploy it to the working system. With this step finished, students are encouraged to submit screen-shots of a running extended system.

<a name="program_3"> Milestone 3: Final deliverable 
---
The deliverable for programming project should consist:

1. An end-to-end description of the project, including design motivation, problem statement, proposed design, implementation notes, system deployment and evaluation results that verify the motivation, 

2. Source code of the project, and description on how to compile, configure, deploy, and execute the program.

3. A proof of the working of the final system. For instance, if you are doing a demo, attach screenshot of the demo in your final report.
