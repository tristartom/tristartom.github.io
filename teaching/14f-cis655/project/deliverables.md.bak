Survey option
===
<a name="survey_0">Milestone 0: Topic selection
---
The submitted document should describe the **chosen topic** and optionally a short paragraph that describes the background and justifies the chosen topic from the perspective of meeting the three criterions mentioned in the project page [[link](http://tristartom.github.io/teaching/14f-cis655/project/termproject.html)].

. The document should include a brief description that justifies the specific topic

<a name="survey_1">Milestone 1: Reference selection 
---
At this stage, students should fix the list of related materials. In the submitted document, it should include all the referenced materials, be it technical research paper, white paper, or technical blogs (posted by reputable companies), that the final report will be based on.

<a name="survey_2">Milestone 2: Preliminary report
---
Submit a preliminary report of at least 4 pages.

<a name="survey_3">Milestone 3: Final deliverable 
---
The final deliverable includes 1) a survey paper which describes the technical advances in the corresponding topic, and 2) a presentation that summaries the results of survey paper in a clear and compact manner. In particular, the survey paper should consist of more than 15 pages (excluding reference list), formatted with one-half spacing, 12 point font, one inch borders. 

In principle, the survey should address the following general questions, although specific paper organization may depend on the topic of choice.

1. What drives the emergence of the new technique? Where do the needs come about? What is the benefit?
2. What are the new technical advances? Describe the technical solution with depth -- elaborate on the protocols, data formats and architectures. Compare the new technique with prior techniques years or decades ago, and describe their differences.
3. List a number of open-source systems (if any) for the new technique. Describe your experiences using them.
4. State the problems that are yet to be solved, and how research or industry can approach them. List a few research problems.

Programming option
===
<a name="program_0"> Milestone 0: Topic selection 
---
Given a group of students, only **one** student (designated as group coordinator) needs to submit the document. The document should describe the **chosen project**, group members including both **student name** and **SUID**.

<a name="program_1"> Milestone 1: Project design
---
Finish the reading component of the project, and conduct an extensive background study. Write and submit a preliminary report on the project design. The project design should include two pieces of information: 1) the plan to deploy the base system, 2) propose ideas on extending the base system for better performance, ease of use, etc.

<a name="program_2"> Milestone 2: Implementation and deployment
---
Follow the project plan to set up and deploy the original system. To demonstrate the working of the system, students should submit a series of screen-shots of **the functioning system**.

Implement the proposed design, test it and deploy it to the working system. With this step finished, students are encouraged to submit screen-shots of a running extended system.

<a name="program_3"> Milestone 3: Final deliverable 
---
The deliverable for programming project will be 1) an end-to-end description of the project, including design motivation, problem statement, proposed design, implementation notes, system deployment and evaluation results that verify the motivation, 2) a demo for the working of the final system.
