Course Project
============

Policy
---

Students can work in groups. But once groups are formed, collaboration is only allowed within the group. More specifically, **inter-group collaboration is prohabited**. Each group can have no more than 3 people.

Deliverable
---

* Mid-term report/presentation (40%): Formal survey of the technology with no less than 5 pages (format: 12-point font size on single-spaced 8.5" x 11‚Äù pages)   
 * Group with good mid-term report will be given an opportunity to do presentation in class. And **in-class presentation will be awarded with bonus grades (extra 30%)**
* Final report (20%): Formal survey of the technology and project design \& implementation, no less than 10 pages (the same format to mid-term report).
* Final program/demo (40%): Demo needs to allow other people to reproduce your results.
