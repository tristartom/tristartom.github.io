<li>[Exercise 2.7] When using the one-time pad with the key k = <span class="math">0<sup><em>l</em></sup></span>, we have <span class="math"><em>E</em><em>n</em><em>c</em><sub><em>k</em></sub>(<em>m</em>)‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ<em>k</em>‚ÄÖ‚äï‚ÄÖ<em>m</em>‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ<em>m</em></span> and the message is sent in the clear! It has therefore been suggested to modify the one-time pad by only encrypting with <span class="math"><em>k</em>!‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ0<sup><em>l</em></sup></span> (i.e., to have <span class="math"><em>G</em><em>e</em><em>n</em></span> choose k uniformly from the set of nonzero keys of length l).

<li>Hint: What the problem means is that even when the actual algorithm <span class="math"><em>G</em><em>e</em><em>n</em></span> does not follow a uniform distribution, one can still assume it follows a uniform distribution, without changing the security of encryption scheme.</li>

3. [Bonus: 20/100] Consider a variable-length Merkle-tree scheme $MT$ and a message space ${M}$ where there is an ordering scheme (i.e. total order between two messages). Use $MT_{M}$ to digest an ordered list of *distinct* messages. Can $MT_{M}$ support the merge operation of the two lists? Given two lists, the merge result is an ordered list of distinct messages. Formally, consider two lists $m^A=m^A_1m^A_2...m^A_t$ and $m^B=m^B_1m^B_2...m^B_{t'}$ where (w.o.l.g.) $m^A_1<m^A_2<...<m^A_t$ and $m^B_1<m^B_2<...<m^B_{t'}$. $m:=merge(m^A,m^B)$ where $m$ contains all blocks in $\{m^A_1,m^A_2,...,m^A_t,m^B_1,m^B_2,...,m^B_{t'}$, is an ordered list, and has all blocks distinct. Denote by $d^A$ the root hash of Merkle tree $MT_{M}(m^A)$ and $d^B$ that of $MT_{M}(m^B)$. Would it be possible to compute $d$, the root hash of $MT_{{M}}(merge(m^A,m^B))$ directly from $d^A$ and $d^B$?
    - Hint: To make it non-trivial, one can ignore the case that two lists are non-overlapping and totally-ordered.

Homework 3

1. **CPA-secure variable-length PrivK encryption (block cipher)** Write programs (with language of your choice) to implement a CPA-secure encryption scheme based on block cipher. In your implementation, you can assume a insecure block cipher (e.g. a fixed permutation or even an identity function). Specifically, implement construction for the following schemes:
    1. Fixed-length encryption (with scheme of your choice),
    2. Variable-length encryption; use CBC mode for domain extension.
2. **OpenSSL** Read online [[tutorial](http://cs.uccs.edu/~cs691/crypto/openssl/example.htm)], finish the following operations. Upload the screenshots as your solution.
    1. create a self signed CA certificate
    2. generate private-public key pair bind to an user, say `CIS600`
    3. request a certificate of user `CIS600` to CA for signing; (hint: use `CIS600`'s public key as his identity)
    4. use the public-private key pair to encrypt and decrypt messages
    5. use the public-private key pair to sign and verify messages 
3. [Exercise 10.4] Consider the following key-exchange protocol: (a) Alice chooses uniform $k, r$ in $\{0,1\}^n$, and sends $s := k\oplus{}r$ to Bob. (b) Bob chooses uniform $t$ in $\{0,1\}^n$, and sends $u := s\oplus{}t$ to Alice. (c) Alice computes $w := u\oplus{}r$ and sends $w$ to Bob. (d) Alice outputs $k$ and Bob outputs $w\oplus{}t$. Show that Alice and Bob output the same key. Analyze the security of the scheme (i.e., either prove its security or show a concrete attack). Note $\oplus$ is XOR.

Amin's sol:

    1. create a self signed CA certificate

mkdir private
openssl req -new -x509 -keyout private/cakey.pem -out cacert.pem -days 365 -config /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf

#cakey.pem private key
#cacert.pem certificate

    2. generate private-public key pair bind to an user, say `CIS600`
    3. request a certificate of user `CIS600` to CA for signing; (hint: use `CIS600`'s public key as his identity)

cp private/cakey.pem private/cakey.pem.enc
openssl rsa -in private/cakey.pem.enc -out private/cakey.pem
