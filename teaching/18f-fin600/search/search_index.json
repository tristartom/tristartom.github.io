In this preliminary report, you should lay out the structure of your report, like sections/subsections you are going to survey. For most sections, you can just put a title there. But there must be at least 1 or 2 sections you have finished surveying. \n\n\nFor instance, if you survey \"techniques for Blockchain throughput\", you can have sections for \"on-chain techniques\" including sharding, new consensus algorithms, etc. and sections for \"off-chain techniques\" including say payment channels and networks, etc. You should finish at least one section, say for payment channels and networks, you fill out the full survey text, describing related technologies in the lightning networks and state channels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMid-term report of project (35%): Design and implementation plan of your project. Be as concrete and specific as possible (e.g., the choice of Blockchain and clients). Bonus points will be given to students/groups with novel design/applications. If you have a preliminary implementation, that will reward you extra points as well.\n\n\nGroup with good mid-term report will be given an opportunity to meet the instructor for advises. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal report (50%): Formal survey of the technology and project design \n implementation, no less than 10 pages (the same format to mid-term report).\n\n\nFinal program/demo (50%): Demo needs to allow other people to reproduce your results.\n\n\nThe demo option is to include in your project submission the screenshots (or better yet, videoshot if you have too many screens to show).
