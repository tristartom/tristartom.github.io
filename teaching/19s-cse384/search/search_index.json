Be as concrete and specific as possible (e.g., the choice of Blockchain and clients). Bonus points will be given to students/groups with novel design/applications. If you have a preliminary implementation, that will reward you extra points as well.\n\n\nGroup with good mid-term report will be given an opportunity to meet the instructor for advises. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal report (50%): Formal survey of the technology and project design \n implementation, no less than 10 pages (the same format to mid-term report).\n\n\nFinal program/demo (50%): Demo needs to allow other people to reproduce your results.\n\n\nThe demo option is to include in your project submission the screenshots (or better yet, videoshot if you have too many screens to show).
