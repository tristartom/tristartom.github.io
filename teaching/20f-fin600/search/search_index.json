But once groups are formed, collaboration is only allowed within the group. More specifically, inter-group collaboration is prohibited. Each group can have no more than 3 people.\n\n\nDeliverables\n\n\n\n\nProposal (15%): one-pager including the chosen topic and members in your team.\n\n\nMid-term report of project (35%): Mid-term needs to include the following elements\n\n\nMotivation of your proposed systems to build, like why do you want to use Blockchain?

Also the choice of Blockchain software and clients\n\n\nBe as concrete and specific as possible (e.g., the choice of Blockchain and clients). Bonus points will be given to students/groups with novel design/applications. If you have a preliminary implementation, that will reward you extra points as well.\n\n\nGroup with good mid-term report will be given an opportunity to meet the instructor for advises. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal program/demo (50%): Demo needs to allow other people to reproduce your results.\n\n\nThe demo option is to include in your project submission the screenshots (or better yet, videoshot if you have too many screens to show).

You should clearly lay out different topics studied in your report. For instance, if you survey \"techniques for Blockchain throughput\", you can have sections for \"on-chain techniques\" including sharding, new consensus algorithms, etc. and sections for \"off-chain techniques\" including say payment channels and networks, etc. \n\n\nHere is a more detailed description of technology review: Topics can come from weekly lecture and class discussions as well as papers in the reading list. You are required write a technology review of 10-15 pages, including figures and references. \n\n\nAn example\n: Write a 10-page summary of the current state of work improving Blockchain throughput. The paper should address the following:\n\n\nWhat is the overall thrust in terms of development and goals, or products and goals of industry in this area?\n\n\nWhat technical solutions or standards exist: elaborate on them.
