Deliverable Proposal (5%): one line or a short paragraph stating your chosen topic. Final report/demo (95%): Demo needs to allow reproducing your results. The demo option is to include in your project submission the screenshots (or better yet, video-shot if you have too many screens to show). We may sample some teams (but not all teams) to do the demo in person. The report should have a descriptive title. Describes what applications your system is to support? Why you choose to support this application? Why it matters? and who/what users can benefit from the application? Describe what specific functionalities your system enables (e.g., what's the input/output of your system)? What's the workflow of your system? Describe the system architecture? You may include a figure showing different system components and how they interact. If possible, describe your future plan. Option B: Technology Review Timeline Topic proposal: March 4 Final submission: March 25 Technical reports must be done individually. Deliverable Proposal (5%): one line or a short paragraph stating your chosen topic. Final report (95%): Format requirement here: [ Google doc ]. Suggested Format for Final Report In general, a good paper summary/tech review should answer the following questions: Paper summary What problem does the paper address? What approach the paper presents to solve the problem? How effective does the proposed approach solve the problem? Paper novelty How is the problem an open problem in the field? What related works are there in the literature? Are there any technical challenges posed by the aimed problem? How does the proposed approach overcome the challenges? A technical review is intended to systematize knowledge on a focused research/technical problem. The following is the suggested structure of final technical review.
