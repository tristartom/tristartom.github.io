But once groups are formed, collaboration is only allowed within the group. More specifically, inter-group collaboration is prohibited. Each group can have no more than 3 people. Only one submission, from the team leader, is needed for a group of multiple students. Your submission should mention the names of all team members. This applies to proposal, mid-term report and final report. Deliverable Proposal (15%): one-pager (one line or a short paragraph) including the chosen topic and members in your team. Motivation of your proposed systems to build, like why do you want to use Blockchain? What benefit does Blockchain bring in your application Initial system design including system modules and assignment to team members. Mid-term report of project (35%): Mid-term needs to include the following elements System architecture, including detailed system modules, both on chain and off chain. Implementation progress. Describe what modules have already been implemented, which tools used in implementation, if possible, a demo with screenshots of your implemented system so far. Implementation plan. Describe what modules have NOT been implemented yet, and the assignment to team members to further the progress. Be as concrete and specific as possible. Bonus points will be given to students/groups with novel design/applications and concrete demos. Group with a good mid-term report will be given an opportunity to meet the instructor for further advises. Final report/demo (50%): Demo needs to allow other people to reproduce your results. The demo option is to include in your project submission the screenshots (or better yet, video-shot if you have too many screens to show). We may sample some teams (but not all teams) to do the demo in person. The report should have a descriptive title. Describes what applications your system is to support? Why you choose to support this application? Why it matters? and who/what users can benefit from the application? Describe what specific functionalities your system enables (e.g., what's the input/output of your system)? What's the workflow of your system? Describe the system architecture? You may include a figure showing different system components and how they interact. If possible, describe your future plan. Option B: Technology Review Timeline Topic selection: Oct. 07, 2022 Final submission: Dec. 11, 2022 Technical reports can also be done by teams. You can form teams of up-to three students. Deliverable Proposal (15%): one-pager (one line or a short paragraph) including the chosen topic and members in your team. Final report (85%): Formal survey of the technology with no less than 10 pages (format: 12-point font size on single-spaced 8.5\" x 11\" pages). You should clearly lay out different topics studied in your report. For instance, if you survey \"techniques for Blockchain throughput\", you can have sections for \"on-chain techniques\" including sharding, new consensus algorithms, etc. and sections for \"off-chain techniques\" including say payment channels and networks, etc. An example of a good technical review paper: [ pdf ] References Example topics to propose: [ link ] Course project slides: [ link ]","title":"Technical review and projects"},{"location":"reading/#technical-review-and-projects","text":"","title":"Technical review and projects"},{"location":"reading/#option-a-programming-project","text":"","title":"Option A: Programming Project"},{"location":"reading/#timeline","text":"Topic proposal: Oct. 07, 2022 Midterm submission: Nov. 21, 2022 Final submission: Dec. 11, 2022 Students can work in groups.
