<li><p><i><u>Summary</u>: This work presents a measurement study examining the security of Ethereum RPC services. The API being exploited is eth_call, which is an essential service operation that support local smart-contract execution for free. An attacker can misuse this API and obtain a zero-cost denial-of-service attack, which we call Denial of Ethereum Rpc Service (DoERS). Novel measurement methods are proposed to uncover load balancing, Gas limits, and other internal behaviors in the otherwise blackbox services. The results show that at the time of measurement, most services are subject to the DoERS attacks.</i></p>

<li><p><i><u>Summary</u>: Given data feeding becomes a critical component in today's DeFi applications, this work presents a cost-effective design of data feeds onto Ethereum like blockchains. The key idea is this: A push-based data feed incurs operations to update smart-contract storage and is expensive under write-intensive workloads (i.e., producing data updates at a high rate without much data reads from smart contracts). A pull-based data fee design incurs transactions to bring off-chain data to the smart contract and is expensive under read-intensive workloads. Thus, we propose GRuB, a workload-aware data replication scheme that can adaptively avoid the high cost of push-based (pull-based) design under write-intensive (read-intensive) workloads. The key technique is a family of online algorithms that make data-replication designs based on the observed workload. We conduct algorithm analysis to show the proposed online algorithms achieve bounded competitiveness. For evaluation, we build a system prototype on Ethereum and several benchmarks based on collected real traces of DeFi applications (e.g., stablecoins and pegged tokens). Our evaluation results show that GRuB achieves up to 55% saving in Gas compared with the baseline designs of statically pushed or pulled data feeds.</i></p>

<ul>
<li><p><i><u>Summary</u>: In this work, we build a query-authenticated data structure over an outsourced key-value store on an Amazon S3 like cloud service. To authenticate the query freshness yet at low costs, the key technical novelty is to index the data attributes inside the intermediate nodes in an Merkle tree. We propose a bloom-filter based encoding scheme and a novel tree structure to admit incremental tree updates and efficient query of logarithmic costs. With an implementation on HBase, we evaluate the system throughput under the industrial-strength YCSB workload. We confirm the proposed storage system offers higher throughput in an order of magnitude for data stream authentication than the existing work. </i></p>

<ul>
<li><p><i><u>Summary</u>: In this work, we build a federated keyword search service over multiple independent document sites. In this distributed system, a site-discovery service is crucial to connect a search to a potential target site. To prevent privacy leakage, the traffic going into the discovery service and coming out is obfuscated; in other words, the keyword-to-site indices maintained by the discovery service are injected with a proper amount of noises with balance between the search/discovery utility and privacy-preserving degree. </i></p>
