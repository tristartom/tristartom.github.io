UTICA, N.Y.

The last two defendants in the Word of Life Church beating case were sentenced Monday morning.

Bruce and Deborah Leonard, the parents of the two teens who were beaten, had two totally different dispositions. That, and the words of some speakers, led to one of them getting their agreed-upon sentence actually reduced.

Deborah Leonard told the judge she is sorry for what happened, but still showed her allegiance to the church. She was charged with asault for whipping the boys several times with an electrical cord and did receive the agreed upon sentence of five years.

Bruce Leonard meanwhile says he is a changed man and says if could go back and do it again, he would step into stop the beatings. Bruce said before he was brainwashed by the church and let the beating go on. His agreed upon sentence was 16 years, but after Bruce's statements and hearing from three other people in court Monday, the judge only sentenced Bruce Leonard to 10 years.
